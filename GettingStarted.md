# Introduction #

In order to get this up and running, you will need to have MonoGame configured with the appropriate plugins for Visual Studio.

Configuring these requirements is outside the scope of this project.

Best installation guide I have found:

This website also has a lot of tutorials for learning the basics of C# and the parts of XNA that will be used in MonoGame.

I suggest browsing through some of these if you are brand new and want to be able to understand the source code in mono-engine
